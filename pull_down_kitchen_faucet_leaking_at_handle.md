## Step-by-Step Process of Repairing a Leaking Faucet Handle

1. **Diagnose the Issue**  
   - Turn off the water supply to the faucet.  
   - Remove the handle to inspect the internal components.  
   - Identify the source of the leak (e.g., worn-out cartridge, damaged O-ring, or loose connections).  

2. **Gather Necessary Tools and Parts**  
   - Common tools include an adjustable wrench, screwdriver, and plumberâ€™s tape.  
   - Replacement parts may include a new cartridge, O-rings, or seals.  

3. **Disassemble the Faucet**  
   - Carefully remove the handle, spout, and any other components to access the leaking area.  
   - Take note of the order of parts for easy reassembly.  

4. **Replace Faulty Components**  
   - Install the new cartridge, O-rings, or seals.  
   - Ensure all connections are tight and secure.  

5. **Reassemble the Faucet**  
   - Put the faucet back together in the reverse order of disassembly.  
   - Use plumberâ€™s tape on threaded connections to prevent future leaks.  

6. **Test the Faucet**  
   - Turn the water supply back on.  
   - Check for leaks and ensure the faucet operates smoothly.  

## Tips for Preventing Future Leaks  

- **Regular Maintenance**: Inspect your faucet periodically for signs of wear and tear.  
- **Use Quality Parts**: Invest in durable components to extend the lifespan of your faucet.  
- **Avoid Overtightening**: Tightening connections too much can damage seals and cause leaks.
