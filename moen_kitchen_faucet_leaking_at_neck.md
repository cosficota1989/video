## Why a Moen Kitchen Faucet is a Reliable Choice  
Moen is a trusted brand in the plumbing industry, known for its durability and innovative designs. Their kitchen faucets are built to withstand daily use, but even the best faucets can develop issues over time. A common problem homeowners face is a leak at the neck of the faucet. While this can be frustrating, itâ€™s often a fixable issue that doesnâ€™t require replacing the entire fixture.  

## Common Causes of a Leak at the Neck  
A Moen kitchen faucet leaking at the neck is typically caused by one of the following:  
1. **Worn-out O-rings**: Over time, the rubber O-rings that create a watertight seal can degrade.  
2. **Loose Connections**: The components of the faucet may loosen due to regular use.  
3. **Mineral Buildup**: Hard water deposits can interfere with the faucetâ€™s function.  
4. **Cracked or Damaged Parts**: Physical damage to the faucet can lead to leaks.  

## Benefits of Repairing vs. Replacing  
Repairing your Moen kitchen faucet offers several advantages:  
- **Cost-Effective**: Repairs are often cheaper than buying a new faucet.
