## Step-by-Step Replacement Instructions

Follow these steps to replace your Pur faucet water filter efficiently:

### Tools and Materials Needed:
- New Pur faucet water filter (ensure itâ€™s compatible with your model)  
- Clean cloth or paper towel  
- Bucket or bowl (to catch any water)  
- Gloves (optional)  

### Step 1: Turn Off the Water Supply
Locate the water supply valve under your sink and turn it off. This prevents water from flowing while you replace the filter.

### Step 2: Remove the Old Filter
1. Place a bucket or bowl under the filter to catch any residual water.  
2. Twist the old filter counterclockwise to detach it from the faucet.  
3. Inspect the filter housing for any debris or buildup and clean it with a cloth if necessary.  

### Step 3: Prepare the New Filter
1. Remove the new filter from its packaging.  
2. Check for any protective covers or seals and remove them.  

### Step 4: Install the New Filter
1. Align the new filter with the housing and twist it clockwise until itâ€™s securely in place.  
2. Ensure itâ€™s tight but avoid overtightening, as this can damage the threads.  

### Step 5: Turn On the Water Supply
Turn the water supply valve back on and run the faucet for 2â€“3 minutes to flush out any air or carbon particles from the new filter.  

### Step 6: Check for Leaks
Inspect the filter and connections for any leaks. If you notice water dripping, turn off the supply and ensure the filter is properly seated.  

## Tips for Maintaining Your Pur Faucet Water Filter
- Replace the filter every 2â€“3 months or as recommended by the manufacturer.  
- Regularly clean the exterior of the faucet to prevent buildup.  
- If you notice a change in water taste or flow, check the filter immediately.  

By following these steps, you can ensure your Pur faucet water filter continues to provide clean, great-tasting water for your home. If youâ€™re unsure about any part of the process, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to a professional plumber in Los Angeles for assistance.
