3. Tighten the connections using an adjustable wrench, but avoid over-tightening to prevent damage.  

### Step 4: Test for Leaks  
Turn the water supply back on and test the faucet for leaks. If any leaks are detected, tighten the connections slightly or reapply plumberâ€™s tape.  

### Step 5: Final Adjustments  
Ensure the faucet handles operate smoothly and the water flows evenly. Clean the faucet and surrounding area to remove any debris.
