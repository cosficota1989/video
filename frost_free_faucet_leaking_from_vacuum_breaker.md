## Why a Frost-Free Faucet Leaks from the Vacuum Breaker  

The vacuum breaker, also known as an anti-siphon valve, is a critical component that prevents backflow of contaminated water into your clean water supply. Leaks often occur due to:  

- **Worn-Out Seals**: Over time, the rubber seals inside the vacuum breaker can deteriorate, causing leaks.  
- **Mineral Buildup**: Hard water deposits can clog the valve, preventing it from sealing properly.  
- **Improper Installation**: If the vacuum breaker isnâ€™t installed correctly, it may not function as intended.  
- **Freezing Damage**: Extreme temperatures can crack or damage the vacuum breaker, leading to leaks.  

## Benefits of Fixing a Leaking Frost-Free Faucet  

Addressing a leaking vacuum breaker promptly offers several advantages:  

1. **Water Conservation**: A leaky faucet can waste hundreds of gallons of water over time, increasing your utility bills.  
2. **Prevent Water Damage**: Continuous leaking can cause erosion, mold growth, or structural damage to your property.  
3. **Extended Faucet Lifespan**: Regular maintenance and repairs ensure your frost-free faucet lasts for years.  
4. **Compliance with Plumbing Codes**: Properly functioning vacuum breakers are often required by local plumbing codes to ensure safe water usage.

## Preventative Maintenance Tips
