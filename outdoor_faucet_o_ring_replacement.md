## Why Replace an Outdoor Faucet O-Ring?

An outdoor faucet O-ring is a small but crucial component that ensures a watertight seal. Over time, exposure to the elements, frequent use, and natural wear and tear can cause the O-ring to degrade. When this happens, leaks, drips, or even complete failure of the faucet can occur. Replacing the O-ring not only prevents water waste but also extends the lifespan of your faucet, saving you money in the long run.
