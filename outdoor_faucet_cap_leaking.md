## Why Fixing a Leaky Outdoor Faucet Cap Matters  

A leaking outdoor faucet cap may seem minor, but it can escalate into a bigger problem if left unattended. Here are the key reasons to address it promptly:  

- **Water Conservation**: Even a small drip can waste hundreds of gallons of water annually.
