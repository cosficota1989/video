## Why Replace a Delta Faucet Cartridge  

Delta faucets are known for their durability, but over time, the cartridgeâ€”the internal component that controls water flow and temperatureâ€”can wear out. Here are some key benefits of replacing it:  

- **Stops Leaks:** A worn-out cartridge is a common cause of dripping faucets. Replacing it can save water and lower your utility bills.  
- **Improves Water Pressure:** Mineral deposits and wear can clog the cartridge, reducing water flow. A new one ensures optimal pressure.  
- **Restores Temperature Control:** If youâ€™re struggling to adjust the water temperature, a faulty cartridge is likely to blame.  
- **Extends Faucet Life:** Regular maintenance, including cartridge replacement, can prevent more costly repairs down the line.
