## Steps to Replace the Bathtub Faucet Stem  

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the process I follow to ensure a seamless stem replacement:  

1. **Shut Off the Water Supply:**  
   - Locate the water shut-off valves for the bathtub and turn them off to prevent water flow during the repair.  

2. **Remove the Faucet Handle:**  
   - Use a screwdriver or Allen wrench to remove the handle. If itâ€™s stuck, a handle puller can help.  

3. **Extract the Old Stem:**  
   - Using a stem wrench, carefully unscrew and remove the old stem. Inspect it for wear or damage.  

4. **Install the New Stem:**  
   - Insert the new stem into the faucet body, ensuring itâ€™s properly aligned. Tighten it with the stem wrench.  

5. **Reassemble the Faucet:**  
   - Reattach the handle and secure it with the screw or bolt.  

6. **Test the Faucet:**  
   - Turn the water supply back on and test the faucet to ensure it operates smoothly without leaks.
