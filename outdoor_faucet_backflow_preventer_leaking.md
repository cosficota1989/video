## Why Is My Outdoor Faucet Backflow Preventer Leaking?

Understanding the root cause of a leaking backflow preventer is the first step toward resolving the issue. Common reasons include:

- **Worn-out seals or gaskets**: Over time, the rubber seals inside the backflow preventer can degrade, leading to leaks.
- **Improper installation**: If the device was not installed correctly, it may not function as intended.
- **Freezing temperatures**: In colder climates, water inside the preventer can freeze and crack the components.
- **Debris buildup**: Dirt, sand, or mineral deposits can clog the preventer, causing it to malfunction.

Repairing or replacing a leaking backflow preventer offers several advantages:
