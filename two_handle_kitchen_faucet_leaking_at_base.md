## Steps to Repair a Two-Handle Kitchen Faucet Leaking at Base  

Hereâ€™s how I typically approach the repair process:  

1. **Turn Off the Water Supply**  
   - Locate the shut-off valves under the sink and turn them clockwise to stop the water flow.  
   - Open the faucet to release any remaining water in the lines.  

2. **Inspect the Faucet**  
   - Examine the base of the faucet to identify the source of the leak.  
   - Check for worn-out washers, O-rings, or damaged cartridges.  

3. **Disassemble the Faucet**  
   - Use a wrench or pliers to carefully remove the handles and spout.  
   - Take note of the order of components to ensure proper reassembly.  

4. **Replace Faulty Parts**  
   - Install new washers, O-rings, or cartridges as needed.  
   - Use manufacturer-recommended parts for optimal performance.  

5. **Reassemble and Test**  
   - Reattach the spout and handles, ensuring all connections are tight.  
   - Turn the water supply back on and test the faucet for leaks.  

## Tips for Preventing Future Leaks  

- **Regular Maintenance:** Inspect your faucet for signs of wear and tear every few months.  
- **Avoid Overtightening:** Tightening handles too much can damage washers and O-rings.  
- **Use Quality Parts:** Invest in high-quality replacement parts to ensure durability.
