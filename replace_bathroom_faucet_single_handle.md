## Steps to Replace a Single-Handle Bathroom Faucet  

### 1. **Turn Off the Water Supply**  
Locate the shut-off valves under the sink and turn them off to stop the water flow. If there are no shut-off valves, you may need to shut off the main water supply.  

### 2. **Remove the Old Faucet**  
Use a wrench to disconnect the supply lines and remove the mounting nuts securing the faucet. Carefully lift the old faucet out of the sink.  

### 3. **Prepare the Area**  
Clean the area around the sink hole to ensure a smooth installation. Check for any corrosion or damage that might need repair.  

### 4. **Install the New Faucet**  
Place the new faucet into the sink hole and secure it with the provided mounting hardware. Connect the supply lines, ensuring they are tight but not overtightened.  

### 5. **Test for Leaks**  
Turn the water supply back on and check for leaks. Run both hot and cold water to ensure the faucet operates smoothly.  

### 6. **Final Adjustments**  
Adjust the handle and water flow settings to your preference. Clean up the work area and dispose of the old faucet properly.  

## Tips for a Successful Faucet Replacement  

- **Choose the Right Faucet**: Measure your sinkâ€™s hole size and ensure the new faucet is compatible.  
- **Invest in Quality**: A durable faucet may cost more upfront but will save you money in the long run by reducing maintenance needs.
