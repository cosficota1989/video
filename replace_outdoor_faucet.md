- **Warranty:** Look for a faucet with a solid warranty to protect your investment.  

## When to Call a Professional

Replacing an outdoor faucet is a small investment that yields significant benefits. Whether youâ€™re tackling this project yourself or hiring a professional, understanding the process and its advantages can help you make informed decisions for your home.
